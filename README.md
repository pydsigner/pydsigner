> `0x2b || !0x2b`, that is the question...

I've been a Python-focused developer for over a decade, and only ever dabbled lightly in C/C++, but `0x2b or not 0x2b` just doesn't have the same ring. I've done backend web dev, true full-stack web dev, and dependency-injection-driven ETL pipelines. Now I'm moving towards education, while staying grounded in real-world software development. I provided technical review for [Dead Simple Python](https://nostarch.com/dead-simple-python); check it out!
